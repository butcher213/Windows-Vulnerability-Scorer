#configuration file for Trevor's scoring system
#
# Author: Trevor Butcher
#
# Description: This file holds configurations that govern all scored vulnerabilities,
# for anybody who wants to use the scoring system and choose what vulnerabilities to score.

# How to use (DO NOT DELETE):
# basically, this is the equivalent of a C header file. it ONLY contains variable definitions.
# call this in every module to import the data.
# IMPORTANT: to avoid confusion, all variables here will use the naming convention HV<variable type><Vulnerability or not (V or no V)>_<variable name>. HV
# stands for "header variable"
# If you want to score, say, automatic updates on firefox, you set that value to True. If it isn't scored,
# it will be set to False. 
# For things like forensics, use list notation. (more info will be with each variable)
# ALL PATHS MUST BE MADE USING "/". \ is an escape character in python and it will break the path. 
# (So C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop is okay. C:\Users\ is not.

#========================================FTP service uptime===================================================
# choose whether or not ftp is running. if False, don't worry about anything else here, or in [FTP].
FTP_scoreUptime = True 
# specify the server (currently, the scoring system does not handle custom ports, so do not do '192.168.0.1:21')
FTP_server = '127.0.0.1'

# give the username and password that will be used to authenticate on the server.
# if anonymous access is valid way to connect, set "anonAccess" to True, and put whatever you want in the username and password keys
FTP_anonAccess = False
FTP_username = 'FTP_user'
FTP_password = 'Falcon2017!'
# specify the path to the test file (the test file is to verify that read permissions work), and then the name of the test file
# if there is only one subdirectory, don't put any /. if there is no subdirectory, set this to False
FTP_directory = 'docs'
FTP_scoredFile = 'code.txt'

#=========================================HTTP service uptime========================================

#=================================================Forensics================================
# choose to score forensics
FV_scoreForensics = True
#To score a forensics question, the data must be inputted into a multi dimensional array. 
#Where the number of lists is the number of FORENSICS QUESTIONS to score, and the items in each list are the answer(s)
#so [[C:\Users, 188], [2], [a, beta, baegels]]
#       Question 1   Question 2  Question 3

#==============================================3rd Party updates===========================================
# choose whether or not to score updating 3rd party applications
UV_scoreUpdating = True
#This list stores the files to check versions. To use, use the following convention:
# [['C:/complete/path/to/file.exe', 'target version number or greater', 'program name'], ['C:/this/file.exe', '54.2.1', 'Program']]
UV_scoredPrograms = [['C:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe', '55.0.3', 'Firefox'], ['C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe', '7', 'Notepad++']]

#======================================= Remote Desktop ===================================
RDP_unknownPublishers = True
RDP_SecureRPCcommunication = True
RDP_clientEncryption = True
RDP_promptForPassword = True

#========================== Internet Explorer Internet Options ============================
# these settings control the points you can score from the "Internet Options" box

# check to see if the "Enable third-party browser extensions*" box is secured (unchecked)
IE_3rdPartyBrowserExtensions = True
# check to see if the "USer HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections" box is secured (unchecked)

IE_integratedWindowsAuthentication = True

#============================================== FileZilla ================================
# choose whether to score filezilla configurations:
FZ_scorefilezilla = True

# score autoban setting
FZ_autoban = True

# score ftp over tls (ssl)
FZ_ssl = True

#==================================== Folder Permissions =================================
# choose whether to score folder/file permissions
FPV_scorePermissions = True

# This list stores files to check permissions for. Here is the convention:
# [['C:/complete/path/to/file/or/folder','Target User or group', 'CACL'],['C:\intepub', 'Users', 'C']]
# Note: CACL is the DOS command used to display DACL (Discretionary Acess Control List)
# values. For the scoring system, the "CACL" value can be one of these:
# R = Read access
# W = Write access (can ADD new files or directories to the specified directory)
# C = Change access (can MODIFY existing files or directories)
# F = Full control
FPV_Permissions = [['C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot', 'Users', 'R']]

# ================================== XAMPP PHP ==============================

PHP_magicQuotes = True

# ================================ XAMPP MYSQL/mariaDB ================================
# Choose whether to score mysql
MYSQL_scoreMYSQL = True
# score disabling remote access and securing the bind address
# in the ini, this would look like:
# bind-address = 127.0.0.1
# skip-networking  (This is all this line should have in it)
MYSQL_remoteAccess = True
